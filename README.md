In this project, I collected 10 globin protein sequences and aligned them using MAFFT, then visualized the alignment in Jalview with Clustal colouring to examine conserved and variable regions. I prepared the aligned dataset for phylogenetic analysis and used Smart Model Selection (SMS), which selected Q.pfam +G+I as the best-fitting evolutionary model. Since Q.pfam was not available on the NGPhylogeny PhyML server, I used the closest supported empirical model, LG, with model frequencies and gamma-distributed rate variation. I then built a Maximum Likelihood tree with 100 bootstrap replicates to assess branch support, where high bootstrap values indicate strong confidence in the grouping of sequences. The PhyML statistics reported a gamma shape parameter of 2.354 and zero invariable sites, showing moderate rate differences across the alignment and no fully conserved positions. Finally, the resulting structure was evaluated using PROCHECK to ensure stereochemical quality and overall structural reliability.
